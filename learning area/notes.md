- Additions performed by computers are not always commutative.

```C
int i,j;

i=1;
j=i++;

// j will receive the value of 1 and i the value of 2.

//j = j - (i + Var + Rem) is the same as j -= (i + Var + Rem)
```
- in the “C” language all strings are treated as arrays.

%d -> int
- ```==``` is a binary operator with left-side binding.
```C
scanf("%d", &value);
```
