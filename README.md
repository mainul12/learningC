Learning C on my own is tricky.

**point makes a double**

e.g **4.0** is a double

3E8 or 6.62607E-34

- Integer variables (like floats) have a limited capacity.
- Additions performed by computers are not always commutative.
- pre- because the variable is modified first and then its value is used; post- because the variable's value is used and then modified.

```C
int i,j;

i=1;
j=i++;

// j will receive the value of 1 and i the value of 2.
```
```C
//j = j - (i + Var + Rem) is the same as j -= (i + Var + Rem)
```
